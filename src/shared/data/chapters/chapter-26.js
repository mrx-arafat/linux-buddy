    overview: 'Welcome to MOUNT A VOLUME - the art of connecting storage to your Linux system! üíΩ If your computer is a house, then mounting volumes is like installing new rooms, closets, and storage spaces. In Linux, everything is a file, and mounting is how you make external storage devices, network drives, and virtual filesystems accessible through your directory tree. We\'re going to transform you from someone who struggles with "device not found" errors to a storage wizard who can mount anything, anywhere, anytime! üöÄ',
