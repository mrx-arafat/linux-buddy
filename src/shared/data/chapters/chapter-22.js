    overview: 'Welcome to DOCKER - the containerization revolution that changed how we deploy software! üê≥ If you\'ve ever struggled with "it works on my machine" problems, Docker is your salvation. Docker packages your application and all its dependencies into lightweight, portable containers that run consistently everywhere. It\'s like having a magical shipping container for your code that works the same whether it\'s on your laptop, a server, or in the cloud. We\'re going to transform you from someone who manually installs software to a containerization wizard who can deploy applications anywhere with a single command! üöÄ',
