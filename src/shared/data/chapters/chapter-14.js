    overview: 'Welcome to CRON JOBS - where you become the time master of your Linux system! ‚è∞ If you\'ve ever wanted your computer to do things automatically while you sleep, eat, or binge-watch Netflix, cron is your digital butler. Cron (Command Run On) is the time-based job scheduler that\'s been faithfully running tasks since the dawn of Unix. Think of it as your personal assistant that never sleeps, never forgets, and never asks for a raise. Whether you want to backup files every night, clean up logs weekly, or send yourself motivational emails every morning, cron makes it happen. We\'re going to turn you from someone who manually runs commands into a time-scheduling wizard who automates everything! üöÄ',
