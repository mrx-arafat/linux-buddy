    overview: 'Welcome to Linux University! üéì Time to learn the secret language that makes Linux users sound like wizards and confuses Windows users. This isn\'t just vocabulary - it\'s your initiation into the cult of people who actually understand how computers work. We\'re covering 101+ essential terms, concepts, and ideas that separate the Linux masters from the GUI peasants. By the end of this chapter, you\'ll be dropping Linux terminology like a seasoned sysadmin, understanding concepts that make other people\'s eyes glaze over, and speaking the ancient language of Unix like you were born in a terminal. Warning: Side effects may include sudden urges to correct people about "GNU/Linux" and an irresistible need to explain why the command line is superior to everything else. Let\'s turn you into a Linux vocabulary ninja! ü•∑',

        title: 'The Linux File System - Your Digital Kingdom\'s Map üó∫Ô∏è',
        content: 'Welcome to the most logical file system ever created! Unlike Windows with its chaotic C:\\ drive madness or macOS with its "let\'s hide everything from users" philosophy, Linux follows the File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS) - a beautifully organized tree structure that actually makes sense. Everything starts from the root (/) and branches out logically. It\'s like a well-organized library where every book has its place, except instead of books, we have binaries, configs, and logs. Once you understand this hierarchy, you\'ll navigate Linux like a filesystem ninja and wonder how you ever survived the Windows folder chaos. Fun fact: This structure is so good that even macOS secretly copied parts of it (but don\'t tell Apple fanboys).',
        codeExample: `# The root of all evil... I mean, the root directory
/                               # "The beginning of everything" - root directory

        title: 'Users, Groups & Permissions - The Linux Security Theater üé≠',
        content: 'Welcome to Linux\'s permission system - the most elegant security model ever created! While Windows treats permissions like a suggestion and macOS hides them behind pretty icons, Linux has a bulletproof system that\'s been protecting servers since before social media existed. Every file and directory has three permission levels: owner (you), group (your team), and others (everyone else). It\'s like having a bouncer for every file who checks IDs and decides who gets in. The beauty is in its simplicity - just three types of permissions (read, write, execute) for three types of users. Master this system and you\'ll understand why Linux runs the internet while other operating systems run... well, desktop computers that get viruses.',
        codeExample: `# === IDENTITY CRISIS RESOLUTION ===
whoami                          # "Who am I?" - current username
id                              # "What are my credentials?" - user/group IDs
id username                     # "What about this other person?"
groups                          # "What groups do I belong to?"
groups username                 # "What groups does someone else belong to?"

# === THE USER DATABASE (Linux\'s phonebook) ===
cat /etc/passwd                 # "Who exists on this system?" - user database
cat /etc/group                  # "What groups exist?" - group database
sudo cat /etc/shadow            # "Show me the passwords!" - encrypted passwords (admin only)

# Decode /etc/passwd format: username:x:UID:GID:comment:home:shell
head -5 /etc/passwd             # See first 5 users safely
grep $USER /etc/passwd          # Find your own entry
grep "bash" /etc/passwd         # Find users with bash shell

# === PERMISSION DETECTIVE WORK ===
ls -l                           # "Show me the permissions!" - long listing
ls -la                          # "Show me EVERYTHING!" - including hidden files
ls -ld /path/to/directory       # "What about this directory?"
stat filename                   # "Give me ALL the details!" - file metadata

# === DECODING THE PERMISSION MATRIX ===
# Format: drwxrwxrwx
# Position 1: d=directory, -=file, l=link
# Positions 2-4: Owner permissions (rwx)
# Positions 5-7: Group permissions (rwx)
# Positions 8-10: Other permissions (rwx)

# Permission meanings:
# r (read) = 4     - "Can I see the content?"
# w (write) = 2    - "Can I modify this?"
# x (execute) = 1  - "Can I run this?" (files) or "Can I enter?" (directories)

# === PERMISSION MATH (octal magic) ===
# 755 = rwxr-xr-x  - "Owner: full control, others: read and execute"
# 644 = rw-r--r--  - "Owner: read/write, others: read only"
# 600 = rw-------  - "Owner only, everyone else: get lost!"
# 777 = rwxrwxrwx  - "Everyone can do everything" (usually a bad idea)

# === PERMISSION MODIFICATION WIZARDRY ===
# Octal method (the quick way)
chmod 755 script.sh             # "Make it executable for everyone"
chmod 644 document.txt          # "Read/write for owner, read for others"
chmod 600 secret.txt            # "Owner only, top secret!"

# Symbolic method (the descriptive way)
chmod u+x script.sh             # "Give owner execute permission"
chmod g-w file.txt              # "Remove group write permission"
chmod o+r file.txt              # "Give others read permission"
chmod a+x program               # "Give everyone execute permission"
chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r file       # "Set exact permissions"

# === OWNERSHIP MANAGEMENT ===
sudo chown user:group file.txt  # "Change owner and group"
sudo chown user file.txt        # "Change owner only"
sudo chgrp group file.txt       # "Change group only"
sudo chown -R user:group dir/   # "Change ownership recursively"

# Find files by ownership
find . -user username           # "Find files owned by user"
find . -group groupname         # "Find files owned by group"
find . -perm 777                # "Find files with 777 permissions" (security risk!)

# === SPECIAL PERMISSIONS (the advanced stuff) ===
chmod +t /tmp                   # "Sticky bit" - only owner can delete files
chmod g+s directory             # "Set group ID" - files inherit group
chmod u+s program               # "Set user ID" - run as owner (dangerous!)

# Check for special permissions
find /usr/bin -perm -4000       # Find SUID programs (run as owner)
find /usr/bin -perm -2000       # Find SGID programs (run as group)
find /tmp -perm +t              # Find directories with sticky bit

# === PERMISSION TROUBLESHOOTING ===
# "Why can\'t I access this file?"
ls -la problematic_file         # Check permissions
groups                          # Check your groups
sudo -l                         # Check sudo permissions

# "Fix common permission issues"
chmod +x script.sh              # "Make script executable"
sudo chown $USER:$USER file     # "Take ownership of file"
sudo chmod 755 directory        # "Make directory accessible"

# === SECURITY BEST PRACTICES ===
# Never do this (unless you hate security):
# chmod 777 file                # "Everyone can do everything" - BAD!
# chmod -R 777 /                # "Destroy all security" - VERY BAD!

# Do this instead:
chmod 644 documents/*.txt       # "Documents: owner write, others read"
chmod 755 scripts/*.sh          # "Scripts: owner write, everyone execute"
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa         # "SSH keys: owner only" - CRITICAL!`

        content: 'Package management is where Linux absolutely destroys other operating systems. While Windows users are downloading .exe files from sketchy websites and macOS users are dragging apps to folders like cavemen, Linux users have sophisticated package managers that handle dependencies, updates, and security automatically. It\'s like having a personal software butler who knows exactly what you need and keeps everything organized. Different distros have different package managers, but they all share the same philosophy: software installation should be simple, secure, and sane.',
        codeExample: `# === APT (Ubuntu/Debian) - The Popular Kid ===

        title: 'Essential Linux Vocabulary - The Secret Language üó£Ô∏è',
        content: 'Time to learn the sacred terminology that separates Linux wizards from mere mortals! This isn\'t just vocabulary - it\'s your initiation into the secret society of people who actually understand computers. Master these terms and you\'ll sound like you\'ve been using Linux since before the internet existed. Warning: Using these terms correctly may result in other people asking you to fix their computers, sudden job offers in tech, and an irresistible urge to correct people who say "UNIX-like" instead of "Unix-like".',
